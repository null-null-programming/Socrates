{"summary":"---\n## instruction:\nThe error is due to attempting to run TypeScript/JSX code with a Python interpreter. The test file is written in TypeScript/JSX, which is meant to be run in a JavaScript environment, not Python. To fix the error, you need to run the test using a JavaScript test runner such as Jest.\n\n1. Ensure that Jest is installed in your project by running `npm install --save-dev jest`.\n2. Configure Jest to work with TypeScript by installing `ts-jest` and `@types/jest` using `npm install --save-dev ts-jest @types/jest`.\n3. Add a Jest configuration file or update your `package.json` to include a Jest configuration section that specifies the use of `ts-jest` for TypeScript files.\n4. Run the test using the Jest command, typically `npx jest` or `npm test`, depending on your scripts configuration in `package.json`.\n\n## File To Rewrite:\nNo file needs to be rewritten; the command used to run the test needs to be corrected.\n\n## Status:\nFAIL\n\n## Send To:\nQaEngineer\n---","stdout":"","stderr":"  File \"/home/nullnull/Socrates/workspace/Socrates/tests/test_frontend/pages/rankings.tsx\", line 3\n    import React from 'react';\n                 ^^^^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n"}
