{"summary":"---\n## instruction:\nThe error is caused by attempting to run a test file with a `.tsx` extension using a Python interpreter, which is not the correct environment for running TypeScript/JavaScript-based React tests. The test file should be run in a JavaScript environment with a test runner like Jest that is configured to handle React components and TypeScript.\n\nTo correct the error, ensure that you are using a JavaScript test runner like Jest and run the test command appropriate for your JavaScript project setup. For example, if you are using Jest, the command might be something like `jest test_frontend/pages/debate.tsx` or simply `jest` if you have a configuration file that specifies the test paths.\n\nAdditionally, the test code imports should not use the `python` keyword, as it is not valid JavaScript/TypeScript syntax. The test code should be written in TypeScript or JavaScript, conforming to the syntax and imports appropriate for those languages.\n\n## File To Rewrite:\ntest_frontend/pages/debate.tsx\n\n## Status:\nFAIL\n\n## Send To:\nQaEngineer\n\n---","stdout":"","stderr":"  File \"/home/nullnull/Socrates/workspace/Socrates/tests/test_frontend/pages/debate.tsx\", line 3\n    import React from 'react';\n                 ^^^^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n"}
