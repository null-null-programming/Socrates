{"summary":"---\n## instruction:\nThe error is caused by attempting to run a JavaScript/TypeScript file with a Python interpreter. The test file is written for a JavaScript environment using Jest, which is a JavaScript testing framework. The correct command to run the test should use a JavaScript environment, not Python. To fix the error, use the Jest command to run the test file instead of the Python command.\n\nThe correct command should be something like this (assuming you have Jest installed):\n```bash\njest test_frontend/pages/index.tsx\n```\nor if using npm scripts defined in `package.json`, it might be:\n```bash\nnpm test -- test_frontend/pages/index.tsx\n```\nor with `yarn`:\n```bash\nyarn test test_frontend/pages/index.tsx\n```\n\nMake sure you have Jest and the necessary dependencies installed in your project.\n\n## File To Rewrite:\nNo file needs to be rewritten, but the command used to run the test needs to be corrected.\n\n## Status:\nFAIL\n\n## Send To:\nQaEngineer\n\n---","stdout":"","stderr":"  File \"/home/nullnull/Socrates/workspace/Socrates/tests/test_frontend/pages/index.tsx\", line 1\n    /**\n    ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n"}
