{"summary":"---\n## instruction:\nThe error is caused by a missing module named 'fastapi' which is required by the `user.py` module. To fix this error, you need to install the 'fastapi' module. You can do this by running the following command:\n\n```bash\npip install fastapi\n```\n\nEnsure that the environment in which the tests are being run has all the necessary dependencies installed.
