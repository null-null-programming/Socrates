## Full API spec



## Shared Knowledge

'main.py' sets up the FastAPI application and includes routes and logic from other backend modules such as auth.py, realtime.py, ai_scoring.py, debate.py, and rankings.py. The frontend communicates with the backend via API calls defined in the backend modules.

## Anything UNCLEAR

Clarification needed on the specifics of the AI scoring system, such as the criteria for evaluation and the source of the training data for the AI model.
